42 Cursus Cub3D

This is the last project in C at 42. The goal was to recreate a basic raycaster with Wolfenstein 3D as a reference.
It was a group project.
I handled the Raycasting and graphic part, and [mtavares](https://github.com/mtavares98) the parsing.
We completed the project in about 2 months.

We used the original textures of Wolfenstein.
The trickiest part for me, was to figure out how to put the X value of a texture into a Wall.

# The Assignment

# Features
-> A working compass
-> FOV in Minimap corresponds to the actual Field Of Vision of the player
-> "P" for pause menu.
-> "M" to hide / show the Minimap

We were going to add enemies, so we implemented a lives system.
If you press "-" you'll lose a life. When it reaches 0 the program stops.
The settings icon is not working.

# The Code Explained

# Conclusion
I really enjoyed this assignment! It was fun, and it is good to have something progressing visually.
Maybe my favorite project until now.
The final grade was 115, as we also completed 3 of the 5 bonuses:
-> Wall Colisions
-> Mini Map System
-> Move FOV With Mouse

Maybe sometime i'll add more things to the game.
